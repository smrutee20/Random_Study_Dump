# The Program Counter (PC) knows the first address of the program (where execution begins) **point3 is imp**

Here’s how the **Program Counter (PC)** knows the first address:

### 1. **Boot Process and the Role of the Bootloader**:
   - **Bootloader**: When a computer or embedded system is powered on or reset, it doesn’t know where to start executing programs. The **bootloader** (a small program embedded in the system's firmware, like BIOS or UEFI in modern computers, or a simple bootloader in embedded systems) takes over the very first time the system starts up.
   - **Initial PC Address**: The bootloader is typically stored at a fixed memory location (often starting from address 0x0000 or some other predefined location, depending on the architecture). The **PC** is initialized to this location, so the CPU begins executing instructions from there when the system is powered on.

### 2. **Program Loading**:
   - **Loading the OS or Application**: Once the bootloader executes, it typically loads the operating system (or the main application) from storage (like a hard drive, flash memory, etc.) into memory. This is done at specific locations in the memory (often far from 0x0000).
   - **Setting Up the PC**: After loading the OS or application, the bootloader sets up the Program Counter (PC) to point to the **entry point** of the program (for example, the starting point of the operating system or application code).

### 3. **Virtual Memory and Address Translation**:
   - **Virtual Memory**: In modern systems with **virtual memory**, the operating system abstracts memory locations and gives the program its own address space. The program's starting address (entry point) is typically specified by the operating system or by the program's executable file format (such as ELF on Linux or PE on Windows).
   - The operating system will load the program into memory and update the PC to point to the address where the program's entry point resides in **virtual memory**.

### 4. **First Instruction and the Program Counter**:
   - For embedded systems or simple processors, the program might start at a known fixed location in memory (like 0x0000 or some other address defined by the system).
   - The **PC** is set by the bootloader or firmware to the address of the first instruction of the program that should be executed. This address might be 0x0000 on some microcontrollers or higher addresses in modern computers.

### Key Points:
- When the system is **reset**, the **Program Counter (PC)** is typically set by the firmware (bootloader) to the **entry point** address of the program (this could be 0x0000 for simple systems or a different address for complex ones).
- The first instruction is located at this entry point, and from there, the program begins executing.
- The bootloader or operating system is responsible for managing the loading of the program and setting the PC to the correct address to start execution.

### In Summary:
- The PC knows where to start executing because it is initialized to the **entry point** address, which is determined by the **bootloader** or **operating system**.
- **0x0000** could be the initial address on some simple systems, but on modern systems, the entry point is often higher in memory, and the bootloader or OS will set the PC to the appropriate address after loading the program into memory.
